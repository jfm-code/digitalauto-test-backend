# API Backend Automation Test

## Project Overview
This project is designed for the [digital.auto](https://autowrx.digital.auto/) web application, but anyone can use this repo and modify the test methods to test the API Backend of any web pages. The way this automation test works is that it makes the https requests and check for the response status and data.

Written in JavaScript for the consistency with the backend codebase, this project also use the Jest Testing Framework, a popular testing framework for backend APIs.

## Repository Structure
- **helper-functions/** : Contains utility functions for configuration, logging, proxy setup, and handling temporary files.
- **test-methods/** : Holds the test files. Each file should follow the *.test.js* naming convention for Jest to recognize it.
- **request-functions/** : Contains functions that handle HTTP requests. These are used by the test method files.
- **logs/** : Stores log files generated by each test method. This folder must exist even if it's initially empty.
- **temp-files/** : Stores temporary text files generated during testing. These files are created by *temp-storage.js* in the helper-functions folder.
- **main.js** : The entry point for running the tests. This file controls which test method files are executed.
- **info.json** : Stores configurable settings like proxy details. Modify this file to adjust settings without changing the code.
- **package.json** : Lists dependencies and scripts. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.

## Adding New Test Methods
### 1. Creating Request Functions:
Add new HTTP request functions in the **request-functions/** folder.
Return these functions for use in the corresponding test method files in the **test-methods/** folder.
### 2. Creating Test Files:
- Place new test files in the test-methods folder. Follow the naming convention: **yourTestName.test.js.** Otherwise, the Jest testing framework won't recognize the test files.
- Use the appropriate HTTP request functions from the **request-functions/** folder.

## Log Management
- Logs are automatically generated for each test file (file that has naming convention **yourTestName.test.js.**) and saved in the **logs/** folder.
- Each test file creates its own log to prevent overly long log files. The name of the log file represents the date and time that the log is generated.

## Proxy Setup
The project automatically detects when a proxy is needed based on your network.
- Modify **info.json** to set the company domain name. This field is required since the project checks if your computer is using the company's wifi network or not.
- Modify the proxy port in the **info.json** if you need to use proxy.

## Notes and Best Practices
- Ensure the order of test methods in **main.js** is correct, especially if tests depend on each other (e.g., creating a testing object in one file, but and deleting it in another file).
- To run the project, simply type **node main.js**
- Avoid hardcoding configuration details in test files; instead use **info.json** for flexibility.
- The script *--experimental-vm-modules --no-warnings* in the **package.json** allow to generate the log separately for each test methods and prevent the unnecessary warnings of the Jest framework. Without *--experimental-vm-modules*, the **main.js** will have errors while executing. 
- Consider adding comments to your test files to describe the purpose and expected outcomes of each test.
